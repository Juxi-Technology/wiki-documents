# 05 Zero-calibration (arrow keys; required for DIY builds)

The servo zeros and the IMU accel zeros are calibrated and baked per unit at the factory, so a
stock unit needs nothing here. A **DIY build must do this page**: a hand-assembled arm will
almost never sit exactly at the center. Even if the horn was not mounted exactly at the
firmware zero, you can fix it here - jog the arm to visually vertical with the arrow keys and
press `z` to declare the **current** pose q=0. The `z` command does not use the IMU and works
at any pose or horn index.

Come back when: a horn was re-indexed, the arm was disassembled/re-assembled, a servo was
replaced, the IMU was replaced/re-mounted (recalibrate the accel), or the arm no longer rests at
the visual center after retracting.

> `z` only shifts the software zero; it does **not** change how the horn index splits the travel
> (PWM 500-2500 µs). If after zeroing one direction runs out of range (the pulse clamps at
> 500/2500 µs and the arm cannot reach a required sequence angle), re-index the horn (about
> 2 teeth on the shoulder) and zero again.

Timing: after the robot is fully assembled and the main firmware is flashed (the DIY path
runs 03 → 04 → 05).

## 5.1 Principle

The firmware defines q=0 as the visual center: arm vertical, both links in one line. The `z`
command is an encoder-style zero: it makes the **current** joint positions q=0 and prints the
corresponding center pulse widths.

## 5.2 Procedure

1. Connect both the battery and USB (servos powered) and run this in the `SR-Support` folder
   with `.venv` activated:

   ```bash
   python tools/hw_shoulder_range.py
   ```

   Close any serial assistant/monitor first (they hold the port); the keys in the window
   below are read by this tool, no serial assistant is needed. Serial tools / the Windows
   UartAssist download are on [page 03, section 3.3](./03-build-flash.md).

   A persistent four-line display updates in place:

   ```
   Up/Dn=BigArm  L/R=SmallArm  Sh:fast
   z=SetCenter  k=Read  n=Home  q=Quit
   SmallArm: +0.000 rad (  +0 deg)
   BigArm:   +0.000 rad (  +0 deg)
   ```

2. Jog with the arrow keys: `↑`/`↓` = big arm ±0.05 rad, `←`/`→` = small arm ±0.05 rad
   (Shift = ±0.20) until the arm looks **vertical and aligned**;
3. Press `z`; the firmware prints:

   ```text
   zero set: shoulder XXXX us, elbow XXXX us (current pose is now q = 0)
   ```

4. Sanity check: press `n` (home), jog a little, home again - the arm must return to the visual
   center you just defined.

## 5.3 Baking (mandatory once satisfied)

`z` only touches RAM; a reboot restores the old zero. When happy:

1. Write the two pulse values into `config.h`
   (`SERVO_SHOULDER_CENTER_US` / `SERVO_CENTER_US`);
2. Shift every waypoint of `EXEC_REF*` and `training/b_line/getup_reference_b39.py` by the same
   offsets (shoulder/elbow each −Δ rad);
3. Reflash and re-test all four directions ([page 07](./07-self-righting.md)).

> A mis-press is harmless: zero again to overwrite.

## 5.4 Related commands

| Command | Function |
|---|---|
| `z` | Current pose becomes q=0 for both joints; prints the new center pulses (RAM only) |
| `k` | Read the current center pulses (shoulder/elbow, µs) |
| `o` / `p` | Shoulder center ±10 µs live trim (reset on reboot) |
