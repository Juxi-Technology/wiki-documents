# 08 WiFi status page and provisioning

This step is optional and not required for self-righting itself. The MuJoCo simulation
window and the live twin have their own page: [page 09](./09-mujoco.md).

## 8.1 Hotspot and status page

Hotspot: SSID `SR-Support`, password `srsupport`, address `192.168.4.1` (`w` toggles it; on by
default at boot). `w` is sent over serial: type `w` in the send box of the serial
monitor/assistant and press Enter; serial tools / the Windows UartAssist download are on
[page 03, section 3.3](./03-build-flash.md).

Join the hotspot and open `http://192.168.4.1` (phones usually pop the portal automatically).
The page refreshes every 300 ms: state, up vector and uprightness bar, joint commands, get-up
pose/phase, Home WiFi state and the twin-stream switch (live mirror on
[page 09](./09-mujoco.md)). If the browser uses a proxy, add an exception for this address.

*Figure 8-1: the robot status page (opened in a browser at the robot's address). In this capture the robot has joined the home WiFi: the Home WiFi card shows the connection state and the Robot IP, with the twin-stream switch below (usage on 9.2).*

## 8.2 Provisioning (join the home WiFi)

On the status page use the Home WiFi card: `Scan` → pick a network → enter the password →
`Connect`. On success the ESP32 runs AP+STA:

- the hotspot stays up (bench work is unaffected);
- the robot is reachable on the home LAN (the page shows its `Robot IP` - use it in the twin command on page 09);
- credentials are stored in NVS and rejoined automatically on boot.

2.4 GHz only; scans/connects are refused while a get-up is running.
