# 09 MuJoCo simulation and the live twin

MuJoCo is used two ways in this project, both with `hardware/v1/robot_v1.xml` (the
same-source model of the real robot):

- **Local simulation**: with no robot attached, loop the four lying poses and their
  get-ups on the computer to validate the reference sequences and watch the motion;
- **Live twin**: the real robot streams its attitude over WiFi and the MuJoCo window
  mirrors the real motion in real time (a digital twin).

The window works the same in both cases: left-drag rotates the view, right-drag pans and
the wheel zooms. Before first use, create and activate the `.venv` as on
[page 02](./02-environment.md) and install the tool dependencies in it
(`pip install -r tools/requirements.txt`, see page 02).

## 9.1 Local simulation window

In the `SR-Support` folder (`.venv` activated):

```bash
python tools/play_getup_executor.py --xml hardware/v1/robot_v1.xml
```

The window is titled `MuJoCo : sr_support_v1` (figure 9-1). The robot is placed in the
four lying poses in turn (`roll_pos` → `roll_neg` → `pitch_pos` → `pitch_neg`); each time
the executor runs the reference sequence with exactly the firmware parameters until the
robot stands, then the next pose is set. The loop repeats until you close the window.
The terminal prints the pose and the result:

```text
--- cycle 1 pose 1/4 requested=roll_pos actual=roll_pos up=(+0.00,+1.00,-0.00)
    executor ok=True up=+1.00 servo=[0.0, -0.0] steps=113
```

`ok=True` means the pose stood up in simulation. On `ok=False`, check the reference
sequence and any parameters you changed against [page 06](./06-debug-and-calibrate.md).

> Known model difference: with the 1x mass model `roll_neg` prints `ok=False` in
> simulation (the model arm mass/friction differs from the real robot, see
> [page 11](./11-reference.md) 11.4); this does not affect the real firmware.

## 9.2 Live twin over WiFi

Prerequisite: the robot has joined the home network as on [page 08](./08-wifi.md) and the
computer is on the same network. The status page shows the robot's address as `Robot IP`;
copy it into the command below.

1. On the status page press `Twin ON` (same as serial `d`);
2. In the `SR-Support` folder with `.venv` activated, run (replace the address with the
   `Robot IP` from the status page):

```bash
python tools/live_twin.py --tcp <Robot IP>:3333
```

The model mirrors the real attitude live (50 Hz quaternion stream) and keeps the body on
the floor; the arm is held at its floor-contact angle like the stalled servo, so it never
penetrates the floor.

- Computer on the robot's own hotspot instead: the address is always `192.168.4.1`,
  `python tools/live_twin.py --tcp 192.168.4.1:3333`;
- Wired alternative: `python tools/live_twin.py --port COM27` (the tool sends `d` to
  enable the stream automatically);
- Offline replay: `python tools/live_twin.py --replay logs/hw_fast_xxx.txt`;
- The twin is read-only apart from toggling the stream: it never sends control commands.

## 9.3 Telemetry logging

```bash
python tools/tcp_log.py
```

Saves the telemetry stream to `logs/wifi_<time>.txt` for offline replay (`--replay`) and
failure analysis. On the hotspot it defaults to `192.168.4.1:3333`; on the home network
pass the `Robot IP` from the status page:

```bash
python tools/tcp_log.py <Robot IP> 3333
```

## 9.4 Simulation and training reference

`training/b_line/` ships the executor, the reference sequences and the simulation
environment - value-for-value identical to the firmware - for replay, validation and
parameter tuning; the model files are described on [page 11](./11-reference.md) 11.1.
