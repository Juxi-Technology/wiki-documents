# 01 Basics

## 1.1 Working principle

SR-Support is a 2-DOF (shoulder + elbow) active self-righting device:

- **Mechanism**: a two-joint arm mounted on a square base; the shoulder swings about the body's
  long axis and the elbow folds the forearm;
- **Sensing**: a 6-axis IMU provides the attitude quaternion; the firmware classifies each fall
  into one of four poses (`pitch_pos/neg`, `roll_pos/neg`, see
  [page 06](./06-debug-and-calibrate.md) 6.5) from the body-frame up vector;
- **Actuation**: a reference-sequence executor - each pose has a waypoint schedule
  (20 ticks per waypoint, 0.08 rad/tick slew) that plants/levers the arm to roll the body back
  upright; `roll_neg` additionally uses elbow-wedge pumps and a whip-slam fallback;
- **Fallbacks**: 14 s timeout, pose re-planning and automatic retry after the fall gate;
  `roll_neg` uses per-stage adaptive holds and exits to retract as soon as it is upright;
- **Verified**: four directions stand up directly in about 1-6 s; the same model drives the
  MuJoCo simulation and the live hardware twin ([page 09](./09-mujoco.md)).
