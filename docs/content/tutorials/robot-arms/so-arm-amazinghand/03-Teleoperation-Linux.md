# Stage 3: Teleoperation (Linux)

This stage starts the teleoperation loop: the leader arm drives the follower arm's motion, and the gripper controls the AmazingHand's opening and closing. This is the key stage for verifying whether the whole system works correctly.

---

## Prerequisites

- Stage 1: Environment Setup and Stage 2: Calibration completed

- Serial port permissions configured

- The three devices are powered on and their serial ports recorded

---

## Running Teleoperation

```Bash
lerobot-teleoperate \
  --robot.type=so101_amazing_hand \
  --robot.port=<follower_arm_port> \
  --robot.hand_port=<hand_port> \
  --robot.id=amazing_hand_follower \
  --teleop.type=so101_leader \
  --teleop.port=<leader_arm_port> \
  --teleop.id=amazing_hand_leader
```

> Replace `<follower_arm_port>` / `<hand_port>` / `<leader_arm_port>` with your machine's actual paths (examples `/dev/ttyACM0` / `/dev/ttyACM2` / `/dev/ttyACM1`).

**Expected behavior**:

- The leader arm's 5 joints → the follower arm follows

- Leader arm gripper → AmazingHand opening/closing (proportional tracking: half pinch = half closed)

> **💡 Parameter notes**:

- `--robot.type=so101_amazing_hand`: follower arm + hand combined robot

- `--robot.port`: follower arm serial port

- `--robot.hand_port`: hand serial port

- `--teleop.type=so101_leader`: leader arm teleoperator

- `--teleop.port`: leader arm serial port

---

## Mandatory on First Run: Direction Verification

After starting, first do a **direction test** to confirm that both of the following are correct:

|Test|Operation|Correct behavior|
|---|---|---|
|Arm tracking|Rotate each joint of the leader arm|The follower arm follows in the same direction|
|Hand opening/closing|Open/pinch the leader arm gripper|Gripper open → hand open; gripper pinched → hand closed|

> **⚠️ Note (what to do if the direction is reversed)**:

- **Hand opening/closing direction reversed** (opening the gripper closes the hand instead): this means the hand angle calibration is inaccurate. Run the calibration tool again (including the gripper direction calibration); the change takes effect automatically once saved, with **no manual file editing needed**. See Stage 2: Calibration.

- **Gripper mapping direction reversed** (opening the gripper closes the hand instead): as above. During calibration, click `[Capture Open]` when the leader arm gripper is **open** and `[Capture Close]` when it is **pinched**; the tool records and saves `gripper_open_pos`/`gripper_close_pos` automatically and loads them at startup.

> After the change, **rerun teleoperation** to verify.

---

## Proportional Tracking Verification

Once the directions are correct, verify the smoothness of the ratio:

1. **Slowly** open the gripper → the hand should open **smoothly** (no jumps)

2. Stop the gripper **halfway** → the hand should also stop halfway

3. Open and close quickly → the hand responds quickly with no lag

> **⚠️ Note (the historical issue of the hand opening/closing too far)**: If the hand closes when the gripper is only half open, it is usually because the "open/clenched" positions were inaccurate during hand angle calibration. Rerun calibration step 3 (the hand angle GUI) to calibrate more precise open/close positions.

---

## Optional: Visualization with Cameras

Add `--robot.cameras` to connect cameras and `--display_data=true` to open a Rerun visualization window (showing camera images + joint states in real time):

```Bash
lerobot-teleoperate \
  --robot.type=so101_amazing_hand \
  --robot.port=<follower_arm_port> \
  --robot.hand_port=<hand_port> \
  --robot.id=amazing_hand_follower \
  --teleop.type=so101_leader \
  --teleop.port=<leader_arm_port> \
  --teleop.id=amazing_hand_leader \
  --robot.cameras='{
    wrist: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 0, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30, fourcc: "MJPG"},
    top: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 1, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30, fourcc: "MJPG"}
  }' \
  --display_data=true
```

> **💡 Notes**:

- `index_or_path` is the camera index; confirm it first with `lerobot-find-cameras` (the numbering differs across machines).

- `fourcc: "MJPG"` is optional and can significantly reduce USB camera bandwidth usage (by switching to MJPEG compression); add it if you see stuttering.

- If you only need one camera, just delete the corresponding line (e.g. `top`).

> **⚠️ Note (rerun dependency and display)**: `--display_data=true` requires the rerun visualization package; if it is not installed, run:

```Bash
pip install "rerun-sdk>=0.24.0,<0.34.0"
```

> Also, the rerun window requires a display server (a local graphical session or `ssh -X`). In a headless environment this **does not affect teleoperation**; just remove `--display_data=true`.

---

## Exiting

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop. The program automatically:

1. Releases torque on the 8 hand servos

2. Disconnects the follower arm / leader arm serial ports

3. Disconnects the cameras (if any)

> **⚠️ Note**: **Do not close the terminal directly** before exiting normally (e.g. `kill -9`), otherwise a serial port lock may be left behind. If the port is occupied after an abnormal exit, kill the leftover process or replug the USB cable.

## Troubleshooting

|Symptom|Cause|Solution|
|---|---|---|
|Serial port `Permission denied`|Permissions not configured|`sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM*`|
|Hand direction reversed|Hand angles or gripper mapping reversed|See "Direction Verification" above|
|Hand opens/closes too far / not enough|Hand angle calibration inaccurate|Recalibrate the hand angle GUI|
|Arm does not follow|Missing calibration / wrong serial port|Confirm the follower arm is calibrated and `--robot.port` is correct|
|rerun error|Visualization dependency / display missing|Remove `--display_data=true`|
|Serial port occupied|Previous abnormal exit|Close the leftover process or replug the USB cable|
