# Chapter 3: Camera Basics

> **[Buy in Store](https://www.juxitech.com/products/esp32-s3-wifi-video-module)**

**Chapter goal**: Understand the NanoCam's camera data pipeline and get to know the AI modes built into the firmware.

## Principle

The NanoCam connects to the camera through the DVP (Digital Video Port) interface. The GC2145 sensor outputs 8-bit parallel pixel data; the ESP32-S3's LCD_CAM peripheral stores it directly into PSRAM via DMA, and the HTTP server then streams it to the browser in MJPEG format.

### Key Concepts

- **DVP**: 8 parallel data lines + 3 synchronization signals (VSYNC/HREF/PCLK)

- **MJPEG**: each frame is an independent JPEG image; the browser loads them continuously to create a video effect

- **PSRAM**: 8MB PSRAM used as the frame buffer, holding 2-4 frames

## Steps

### 3.1 Viewing the Default Image

After flashing, the firmware is in streaming mode by default; open `http://<IP>` in a browser to see the image.

|Command|Function|
