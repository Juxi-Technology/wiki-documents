# Chapter 10: AI Vision Understanding

> **[Buy in Store](https://www.juxitech.com/products/esp32-s3-wifi-video-module)**

**Chapter goal**: Have the NanoCam take photos and hand them to a multimodal large model for analysis, so it can "say out loud" what it sees.

## About This Chapter

AI vision understanding is a feature exclusive to **ESP-Claw (mode 7)**; it is not used in XiaoZhi AI (mode 6).

> For the `self.camera.take_photo` and `self.camera.inspect_image` tools used in this chapter, the vision analysis API address is delivered automatically by the server during the MCP handshake through the `capabilities.vision` field. The firmware side does not need to configure the API URL manually — this means the API configuration is done in the xiaozhi.me console or on a self-hosted server; for details see [Chapter 11: ESP-Claw Voice Control](./Ch11-ESP-Claw-Voice-Control.md).

## Principle

The complete vision analysis flow:

```Plain
User voice "Take a look at what's on the table"
  → ASR speech recognition
  → LLM decides: photo analysis is needed → calls self.camera.take_photo or self.camera.inspect_image
  → Firmware: esp_camera_fb_get() captures a frame (VGA RGB565)
  → JPEG compression
  → Sent through Explain() to the Vision API delivered by the server
  → Multimodal LLM returns a text description
  → TTS voice announcement
```

### Differences Between the Two Photo Tools

|Tool|Purpose|Who calls the Vision API|
|---|---|---|
|`self.camera.take_photo`|Takes a photo and describes it with the LLM's built-in vision capability|Server side|
|`self.camera.inspect_image` (NanoCam-specific)|Takes a photo, then calls `camera->Explain()` → HTTP POST to a dedicated multimodal API|Firmware side|

The difference between the two: `take_photo` goes through the XiaoZhi server's LLM vision (a general-purpose implementation), while `inspect_image` is this project's dedicated implementation — the firmware calls a dedicated multimodal API directly (with the address delivered by the server).

## Steps

### 10.1 Make Sure You Are in ESP-Claw Mode

```Plain
ai_mode:7
```

After the device reboots, it enters ESP-Claw mode.

> For the complete commands, see the [Serial Protocol Manual](./ESP32-NanoCam-Serial-Protocol.md).

### 10.2 Photo + AI Analysis

After waking it up, just ask your question:

```Plain
💬 "Take a look at what's here"
💬 "Is there a cup in front of me"
💬 "What color is this book"
💬 "How many apples are on the table"
💬 "Read what's written on this sheet of paper"
```

The NanoCam takes a photo, uploads it, analyzes it, and answers with voice.

### 10.3 Scene Recognition Examples

|Voice input|Example AI reply|
|---|---|
|"What is this"|"This is a black laptop with a white coffee cup next to it"|
|"Are there any apples"|"I don't see any apples. There are two books and a pen on the table"|
|"What color"|"You're pointing at a red mug"|
|"How many cups"|"There are 2 cups in the image"|

## Code

### Core Photo + Analysis Callback

`nanocam_espclaw/main/boards/nanocam/nanocam_board.cc` — MCP tool registration:

```C++
mcp.AddTool("self.camera.inspect_image",
    "Take a photo with the camera and send it to the vision AI for analysis.",
    PropertyList({ Property("prompt", kPropertyTypeString) }),
    [this](const PropertyList &props) -> ReturnValue {
        auto camera = GetCamera();
        if (!camera->Capture()) {
            return std::string("{\"error\":\"Camera capture failed\"}");
        }
        std::string prompt = props["prompt"].value<std::string>();
        return camera->Explain(prompt);
    });
```

`nanocam_espclaw/main/boards/common/esp32_camera.cc` — Explain() implementation:

```C++
std::string Esp32Camera::Explain(const std::string &question) {
    // explain_url_ is delivered by the server during the MCP handshake through capabilities.vision.url
    // Capture frame → JPEG compression → HTTP POST to the multimodal API
    // Return the LLM analysis result
}
```

### Server-Side MCP Handshake (Vision API Delivery)

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "vision": {
      "url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
      "token": "sk-..."
    }
  }
}
```

After receiving it, the firmware calls `camera->SetExplainUrl(url, token)` to save the API address, which is then used directly by subsequent `inspect_image` calls.

## Supported Multimodal Models

By delivering a different `vision.url` from the server, you can use any OpenAI-compatible API:

|Model|API address example|Use case|
|---|---|---|
|`gpt-4o`|`https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`|Strongest overall capability|
|`gpt-4o-mini`|`https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`|Great cost-performance|
|`qwen-vl-max`|`https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions`|Better Chinese understanding|
|`llava:13b` (Ollama)|`http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions`|Fully offline|
|`claude-fable-5`|Proxy configuration required|Detailed scene descriptions|

## Result

"Take a look at what's here" → photo upload → AI analysis → voice announcement "I see a red cup on a wooden table" — a true AI eye.
